In this project, we study an experiment conducted from 2002-2004, where participants "speed date" with other participants for about 4 minutes. At the end of the date, each participant was asked whether they want to see that date again or not. Everything from each date was listed in the spreadsheet, ranging from the attributes of each individual (age, race, etc) to their personality traits (opinions on certain hobbies, interests, etc). We want to dissect this spreadsheet further and see if we can gain some further insight.
